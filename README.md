- this is an outdated personal website that I made for fun a few years ago when I have literally no idea of what I am doing.
- JS and jquery mostly copy pasted from stackoverflow.
- lots of cringe material and also bad coding practices lol, like using aspect ratio instead of min-width for media queries.
- font-size properties use vw instead of em/rem. incredible.
